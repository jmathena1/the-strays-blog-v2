	<p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/student-debt-relief-payment-pause-free-colege-military-navy-recruitment-education-11649800856">WSJ op-ed</a> made
its rounds through my little corner of lefty twitter. I&rsquo;m not a subscriber, so I did not read it.
Take this post with however big a grain of salt you feel appropriate.</p>
<p>The op-ed title and subtitle read:
&ldquo;<strong>An Unintended Consequence of Student-Debt Relief</strong> - <em>Will young Americans volunteer for the armed forces in adequate numbers?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty disappointed Chrome incognito mode couldn&rsquo;t bust me into this article. I considered many career paths in and around the US Military to
help pay off my student loan debt. I&rsquo;m curious exactly how common a path this is.</p>
<p>My immediate guess is: pretty common. Americans valorize going into military or police service.
College students probably see loan forgiveness on top of additional respect as a win-win. I certainly did.
But after working in and around Intel and Law Enforcement, I realized two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a terrible career path for me.</li>
<li>I convinced myself to want this career path because of the social benefits and the loan forgiveness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number one deserves its own posts - or series, and I&rsquo;m certainly not the first person to critique the US Military -  but two I can get into.</p>
<p>Both my parents are lifelong public servants (my dad a civil engineer and my mom a journalist, teacher, and now principal).
I grew up dreaming of serving my community. I did well in language classes through grade school and had an &lsquo;analytical&rsquo; mind.
Post 9/11, young nerds who loved languages and wanted to serve found a very well lit path to Uncle Sam&rsquo;s HR department.
But there are lots of jobs where you serve your people and don&rsquo;t involve volunteering to kill or be killed (or support those that do).</p>
<p>Many of those jobs pay shit (read: teaching, social work, nursing&hellip;and many many many more).
And many don&rsquo;t carry the glorious weight of having &lsquo;served&rsquo;, though many damn well should.
I&rsquo;m not bashing individual cops or soldiers. I&rsquo;ve worked with many and many earnestly try to do good work.
But without going into number one, as I said I wouldn&rsquo;t, both jobs require you be ready to end another person&rsquo;s life as part of your job.
That&rsquo;s a serious fucking act.
And we should not be lamenting this country taking a baby step in creating a more just education system because
some kids might not be pushed toward killing in order to finance their schooling.</p>
