      <div class="blog-post-summary"> Though I don&rsquo;t feel anything from pt 1 was incorrect, I wanted lend a bit more credulity to AI and Machine Learning work. I&rsquo;m gonna reference mostly work and posts from a machine learning engineer and tech writer I follow, Vicki Boykis. She has a great post from Feb 2023 on Chat GPT titled &ldquo;What should you use Chat GPT for?&rdquo;. Part of her assessment from then:
&ldquo;So, for myself, my rules for engaging with Chat GPT are to give it small, inconsequential things it can iterate well on and that I have the ability to check&hellip;&rdquo; </div>

      <div class="blog-post-summary"> I&rsquo;m trying to get in the habit of blogging a bit more frequently so this will seem less collected than other posts.
I&rsquo;ve largely avoided tinkering too much with the various generative AI tools. Mostly because I have little patience for signing up for new things and I&rsquo;ve largely found my current methods of looking things up and getting things done adequate (maybe that&rsquo;s my age showing). On top of that, especially for the latest OpenAI product Sora, I truly don&rsquo;t understand why you would want to use this. </div>

      <div class="blog-post-summary"> (Minor spoilers for The Bear season 2 lie ahead)
Episode four of season two of The Bear takes a slight detour from a Chicago family restaurant aiming to reinvent itself to a high-end kitchen in the Netherlands. The Chicago shop&rsquo;s head chefs send their baker, Marcus, to Copenhagen to learn some new dishes from a pastry chef named Luca.
Bright and early just before 5 am after crossing an ocean, Marcus meets Luca in the kitchen and hits the ground running. </div>

      <div class="blog-post-summary"> A WSJ op-ed made its rounds through my little corner of lefty twitter. I&rsquo;m not a subscriber, so I did not read it. Take this post with however big a grain of salt you feel appropriate.
The op-ed title and subtitle read: &ldquo;An Unintended Consequence of Student-Debt Relief - Will young Americans volunteer for the armed forces in adequate numbers?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m pretty disappointed Chrome incognito mode couldn&rsquo;t bust me into this article. </div>
